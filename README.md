# reaction-synthesizer
Generate chemical reactions for some basic computational constructs

This class **ReactionSynthesizer** is a model class which approximates
possible chemical reactions generated during various computing constructs.
The following constructs are currently supported - 

**NOT** - See `abs()` and `abs2step()`

**Increment** - See `increment()`

**Decrement** - See `decrement()`

**Copy** - See `copy()`

**Compare (If a > b)** - See `ifGreaterThan()`

**Selection Sort** - See `sort()`
