# reaction-synthesizer
Generate chemical reactions for some basic computational constructs

This class **ReactionSynthesizer** is a model class which approximates
possible chemical reactions generated during various computing constructs.
The following constructs are currently supported - 

NOT - See abs() and abs2step()

Increment - See increment()

Decrement - See decrement()

Copy - See copy()

If a > n - See ifGreaterThan()

Selection Sort - See sort()
